						<ol>
<li> Allow events to change you. You have to &nbsp;be willing to grow. 
Growth is different from something that happens to you. You produce it. 
You live it. The prerequisites for growth: the openness to experience 
events and the willingness to be changed by them.</li>
<li> Forget about good. Good is a known quantity. Good is what we all 
agree on. Growth is not necessarily good. Growth is an exploration of 
unlit recesses that may or may not yield to our research. As long as you
 stick to good you’ll never have real growth.</li>
<li>Process is more important than outcome. When the outcome drives the 
process we will only ever go to where we’ve already been. If process 
drives outcome we may not know where we’re going, but we will know we 
want to be there.</li>
<li>Love your experiments (as you would an ugly child). Joy is the 
engine of growth. Exploit the liberty in casting your work as beautiful 
experiments, iterations, attempts, trials, and errors. Take the long 
view and allow yourself the fun of failure every day.</li>
<li>Go deep. The deeper you go the more likely you will discover something of value.</li>
<li>Capture accidents. The wrong answer is the right answer in search of
 a different question. Collect wrong answers as part of the process. Ask
 different questions.</li>
<li>Study. A studio is a place of study. Use the necessity of production as an excuse to study. Everyone will benefit.</li>
<li>Drift. Allow yourself to wander aimlessly. Explore adjacencies. Lack judgment. Postpone criticism.</li>
<li>Begin anywhere. John Cage tells us that not knowing where to begin is a common form of paralysis. His advice: begin anywhere.</li>
<li>Everyone is a leader. Growth happens. Whenever it does, allow it to 
emerge. Learn to follow when it makes sense. Let anyone lead.</li>
<li>Harvest ideas. Edit applications. Ideas need a dynamic, fluid, 
generous environment to sustain life. Applications, on the other hand, 
benefit from critical rigor. Produce a high ratio of ideas to 
applications.</li>
<li>Keep moving. The market and its operations have a tendency to 
reinforce success. Resist it. Allow failure and migration to be part of 
your practice.</li>
<li>Slow down. Desynchronize from standard time frames and surprising opportunities may present themselves.</li>
<li>Don’t be cool. Cool is conservative fear dressed in black. Free yourself from limits of this sort.</li>
<li>Ask stupid questions. Growth is fuelled by desire and innocence. 
Assess the answer, not the question. Imagine learning throughout your 
life at the rate of an infant.</li>
<li>Collaborate. The space between people working together is filled 
with conflict, friction, strife, exhilaration, delight, and vast 
creative potential.</li>
<li> ____________________. Intentionally left blank. Allow space for the ideas you haven’t had yet, and for the ideas of others.</li>
<li>Stay up late. Strange things happen when you’ve gone too far, been 
up too long, worked too hard, and you’re separated from the rest of the 
world.</li>
<li>Work the metaphor. Every object has the capacity to stand for something other than what is apparent. Work on what it stands for.</li>
<li>Be careful to take risks. Time is genetic. Today is the child of 
yesterday and the parent of tomorrow. The work you produce today will 
create your future.</li>
<li>Repeat yourself. If you like it, do it again. If you don’t like it, do it again.</li>
<li>Make your own tools. Hybridize your tools in order to build unique 
things. Even simple tools that are your own can yield entirely new 
avenues of exploration. Remember, tools amplify our capacities, so even a
 small tool can make a big difference.</li>
<li>Stand on someone’s shoulders. You can travel farther carried on the 
accomplishments of those who came before you. And the view is so much 
better.</li>
<li>Avoid software. The problem with software is that everyone has it.</li>
<li>Don’t clean your desk. You might find something in the morning that you can’t see tonight.<p></p>
</li><li>Don’t enter awards competitions. Just don’t. It’s not good for you.</li>
<li>Read only left–hand pages. Marshall McLuhan did this. By decreasing 
the amount of information, we leave room for what he called our 
‘noodle’.</li>
<li>Make new words. Expand the lexicon. The new conditions demand a new 
way of thinking. The thinking demands new forms of expression. The 
expression generates new conditions.</li>
<li>Think with your mind. Forget technology. Creativity is not device–dependent.</li>
<li>Organization = Liberty. Real innovation in design, or any other 
field, happens in context. That context is usually some form of 
cooperatively managed enterprise. Frank Gehry, for instance, is only 
able to realize Bilbao because his studio can deliver it on budget. The 
myth of a split between ‘creatives’ and ‘suits’ is what Leonard Cohen 
calls a “charming artifact of the past.”</li>
<li>Don’t borrow money. Once again, Frank Gehry’s advice. By maintaining
 financial control, we maintain creative control. It’s not exactly 
rocket science, but it’s surprising how hard it is to maintain this 
discipline, and how many have failed.</li>
<li>Listen carefully. Every collaborator who enters our orbit brings 
with him or her a world more strange and complex than any we could ever 
hope to imagine. By listening to the details and the subtlety of their 
needs, desires, or ambitions, we fold their world onto our own. Neither 
party will ever be the same.</li>
<li>Take field trips. The bandwidth of the world is greater than that of
 your TV set, or the Internet, or even a totally immersive, interactive,
 dynamically rendered, object–oriented, real–time, computer 
graphic–simulated environment.</li>
<li>Make mistakes faster. This isn’t my idea—I borrowed it. I think it belongs to Andy Grove.</li>
<li> Imitate. Don’t be shy about it. Try to get as close as you can. 
You’ll never get all the way, and the separation might be truly 
remarkable. We have only to look to Richard Hamilton and his version of 
Marcel Duchamp’s large glass to see how rich, discredited, and underused
 imitation is as a technique.</li>
<li>Scat. When you forget the words, do what Ella did: make up something else… but not words.</li>
<li>Break it, stretch it, bend it, crush it, crack it, fold it.</li>
<li>Explore the other edge. Great liberty exists when we avoid trying to
 run with the technological pack. We can’t find the leading edge because
 it’s trampled underfoot. Try using old–tech equipment made obsolete by 
an economic cycle but still rich with potential.</li>
<li>Coffee breaks, cab rides, green rooms. Real growth often happens 
outside of where we intend it to, in the interstitial spaces—what Dr. 
Seuss calls “the waiting place.” Hans Ulrich Obrist once organized a 
science and art conference with all of the infrastructure of a 
conference—the parties, chats, lunches, airport arrivals—but with no 
actual conference. Apparently it was hugely successful and spawned many 
ongoing collaborations.</li>
<li>Avoid fields. Jump fences. Disciplinary boundaries and regulatory 
regimes are attempts to control the wilding of creative life. They are 
often understandable efforts to order what are manifold, complex, 
evolutionary processes. Our job is to jump the fences and cross the 
fields.</li>
<li>Laugh. People visiting the studio often comment on how much we 
laugh. Since I’ve become aware of this, I use it as a barometer of how 
comfortably we are expressing ourselves.</li>
<li>Remember. Growth is only possible as a product of history. Without 
memory, innovation is merely novelty. History gives growth a direction. 
But a memory is never perfect. Every memory is a degraded or composite 
image of a previous moment or event. That’s what makes us aware of its 
quality as a past and not a present. It means that every memory is new, a
 partial construct different from its source, and, as such, a potential 
for growth itself.</li>
<li>Power to the people. Play can only happen when people feel they have
 control over their lives. We can’t be free agents if we’re not free.</li>
